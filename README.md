# Pandemic-Database

## Introduction
This repository collects meta data for recent large pandemics taken place around the world. The dataset contains frequently reported case number, reproduction rate, transmission pathways, mortality rate, hospitalization rate, latent period, incubation period, and average hospitalization length for the recorded pandemics. 

## Selected Meta Features
| Features | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Basic Reproduction rate (R0) | The expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection.
| Transmission pathways | Whether the pathogen is transmitted through objects, blood, air, vector, and droplets. 
| Mortality rate | The rate of death during the pandemic
| Hospitalization rate | The rate of an infected patient being hospitalized
| Latent period | Number of days between being infected and capable of transmitting pathogens. 
| Incubation period | Number of days between being infected and the appearance of the first symptom.
| Average hospitalization length | The average number of days the patient stays in the hospital.
